Classic arcade game Snake.
In Snake, the player uses the keyboard to control a snake by directing its movement up, down left, or right. As the snake moves around the playing area, apples appear. When the snake reaches an apple, it eats the apple and grows longer. But if the snake hits a wall or runs into part of its own body, the game is over.
